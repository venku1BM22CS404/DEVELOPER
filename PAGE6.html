        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-2">Computer Science Computer science is one of the fastest growing career fields in modern history. Dating back only a few decades to the late 1950's and early 1960's, it has become on of the leading industries in the world today. Developed through the technological architecture of electrical engineering and the computational language of mathematics, the science of computer&nbsp;technology has provided considerable recognition and financial gain for many of its well deserving pioneers. Originally conceived as an organizational solution to the massive amounts of information kept on nothing more than paper, computers have evolved and advanced to become a common part of modern day life.</p>
