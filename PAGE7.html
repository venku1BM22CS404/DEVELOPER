        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-2">Electronics and Communication Engineering is growing day by day in every country. It has an important role from defence sector to space programs to the basic need of human beings including the internet to the entertainment industry. Electronics and Communication Engineering has a wide scope as compared to other. A research work can be done in this field individually. There are a lot of things to learn and research.We can see and observe the growth and researchers in Electronics and communication field. The size of all kinds of electronic gadgets is decreasing day by day. It shows the capability of ECE engineers. Each and everything in the world is connected with electronics.</p>

        <ul class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-default u-text-4">
          <li>Internet of Things (IoT) based weather monitoring system: Develop a weather monitoring system that uses IoT sensors to collect data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and then transmit this data wirelessly to a central server or cloud database. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Wireless power transfer system: Build a wireless power transfer system that uses resonant magnetic induction to transfer electrical energy wirelessly between two or more devices, without the need for physical connections. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Real-time traffic monitoring system: Develop a real-time traffic monitoring system that uses wireless sensor networks to collect data on traffic volume, speed, and congestion, and then transmit this data wirelessly to a central control center for analysis and management. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Smart energy management system: Create a smart energy management system that uses sensors and wireless communication to monitor and control energy consumption in homes, buildings, or industrial facilities, helping to optimize energy usage and reduce costs. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Satellite communication system: Design and build a satellite communication system that can transmit and receive data, voice, and video signals from remote locations, enabling communication and connectivity in areas where traditional terrestrial communication systems are not available or practical.3</li>
